In the project directory, the code for your app is in lib/main.dart.

Run the app

 #. Make sure a target device is selected in the lower, right-hand corner of VS Code
 #. Press the F5 button on the keyboard, or invoke Debug>Start Debugging
 #. Wait for the app to launch

If everything works, after the app has been built, you should see your starter app on your device.

Mod the app
-----------

Edit lib/main.dart change "Flutter Demo Home Page" to "Flutter Smoke Test".  Go to terminal and press "r" to reload.  The smoketest_app should update.
